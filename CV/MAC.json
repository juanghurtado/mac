      "description": "I started as a Front-end developer in **2004**, back when **most of our job was fighting with Internet Explorer**… From that time until today, I’ve experienced firsthand:  - the birth of jQuery - the rise of SPAs - the emergence of CSS preprocessors - CSS-in-JS - new frameworks popping up every day  And here I am now, as motivated as ever. **Learning and improving every day**, because nobody knows everything in the tech world.  I carry a bag full of experiences of all kinds on my back. And I’ve met so many great people along the way, from whom I’ve learned a lot — not only in technical aspects but in many others as well.  If I had to highlight something about myself, it wouldn’t be my knowledge of front-end development, as every day I become more aware of everything I don’t know. However, I would highlight **my ability to learn everything I need to in order to do my job** with quality and efficiency.",

But on the other hand, I also love doing my bit by leading a somewhat larger team with less experienced people and giving them everything I have learned over the years.\n\nI wouldn't like to have a rigid schedule, I need to balance my family life with my work life. I like people who treat each other with respect and who value responsibility more than a time-tracking tool.",
    "goodPractices": "I’m not a fan of buzzwords; for me, the best design pattern is common sense. And experience has shown me that, most of the time, this holds true.\n\nI strive to be pragmatic while writing code with the mindset that someone (possibly myself) will need to revisit it later to modify or extend it. This is why I always try to make things as simple and explicit as possible.\n\nTo achieve this, I aim to follow the SOLID principles (without obsessing over them—pragmatism always comes first).\n\nSpecifically, I’m particularly focused on clearly separating responsibilities and decoupling anything that could cause issues in the future.",
