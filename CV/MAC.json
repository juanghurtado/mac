      "description": "Web developer focused on front-end, using W3C standards such as HTML5, CSS3… Also developing SPAs with Angular and React (and old glories: Backbone.js, MarionetteJS, ExtJS…).  I also have experience developing backend code: PHP, Java, JSF, JSP, Ruby on Rails, Node.js with Express framework… The language doesn't matter, what matters is solving the problem.  I've used many CMS: Drupal, OpenCms, Wordpress… And some static sites generators: nanoc, Jekyll…  I can also write mobile apps for iPhone, iPad and Android using technologies such as PhoneGap and Appcelerator Titanium. I've also write some code for native mobile SDK's: iOS and Android. I have two apps published on Google Play Store!  My prefered workspace is OS X, with lot of terminal usage (ZSH shell) to mess around with Git (or any other VCS).   Oh, I almost forgot, I love testing my code! (Jasmine, Mocha, Sinon…)  Tags: front-end, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, microformats, typography, CSS3, HTML5, Ajax, front-end frameworks, mobile, iPhone, iPad, Android, PhoneGap, Appcelerator, Git, ZSH, Ruby, Backbone, Marionette, ExtJS, Node.js, Express, Rails, Ruby, Angular, React",

But on the other hand, I also love doing my bit by leading a somewhat larger team with less experienced people and giving them everything I have learned over the years.\n\nI wouldn't like to have a rigid schedule, I need to balance my family life with my work life. I like people who treat each other with respect and who value responsibility more than a time-tracking tool.",
    "goodPractices": "I’m not a fan of buzzwords; for me, the best design pattern is common sense. And experience has shown me that, most of the time, this holds true.\n\nI strive to be pragmatic while writing code with the mindset that someone (possibly myself) will need to revisit it later to modify or extend it. This is why I always try to make things as simple and explicit as possible.\n\nTo achieve this, I aim to follow the SOLID principles (without obsessing over them—pragmatism always comes first).\n\nSpecifically, I’m particularly focused on clearly separating responsibilities and decoupling anything that could cause issues in the future.",
